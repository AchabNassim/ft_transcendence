🏓 ft_transcendence – Online Multiplayer Pong

Welcome to ft_transcendence, a modern twist on the classic Pong game with online multiplayer, tournaments, AI opponents, and much more! This project was built with Django, Javascript, WebSockets and a microservices architecture to deliver a seamless, real-time gaming experience.

🎮 My Contribution – The Heart of the Game
As the Game Lead, I was responsible for bringing the Pong experience to life. Here’s what I built:

🕹️ Core Gameplay

    Smooth, Real-Time Pong – Built the game logic from scratch, ensuring fluid paddle movement and ball physics.

    Multiplayer Mode – Implemented WebSocket-based multiplayer so players can compete online in real-time.

    Tournament System – Designed a bracket-style tournament mode where players face off in sequential matches.

    AI Opponents – Created AI with three difficulty levels (Easy, Hard, Impossible), each with unique behaviors. The AI predicts ball trajectories and simulates human-like reactions.

🎨 UI & Matchmaking

    Game UI Components – Developed interactive menus, scoreboards, and in-game HUD using vanilla HTML, CSS, and Web Components.

    Matchmaking Interface – Built a lobby system where players can queue for matches, join tournaments, or challenge friends.

    Responsive Design – Ensured the game works flawlessly on different screen sizes.

⚡ Performance & Networking

    Optimized WebSocket Communication – Reduced latency for real-time gameplay.

🚀 Features (Team Effort!)

While I handled the game itself, our team also implemented:

    🔒 Secure Authentication (OAuth, JWT)

    💬 Live Chat (DM, blocking, game invites)

    🛠️ Backend with Django & Lua Scripts (server-side processing)

    📊 Stats & Leaderboards (Track wins, losses, rankings)

    🎛️ Customization Options (Different game modes & rules)

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Components, WebSockets

    Backend: Nginx, Python, Django, Redis, Postgresql, Lua...

    Networking: WebSockets, HTTP

    Security: OAuth, JWT

🌟 Why It’s Cool

This isn’t just Pong—it’s Pong evolved. Whether you're playing against friends, climbing the leaderboards, or facing an AI that actually challenges you, every match feels fresh and competitive.
